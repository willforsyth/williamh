				<p>I have worked within the web industry for several years starting with web design and building small interfaces to currently working front end developer. I have experience planning web projects gathering resources, creating user journeys, personas and creating wireframes and planning out the User experiences, through to prototypes and full front end builds. I work as a main contributor to a custom pattern library that we use on all projects, which I am very passionate about. It uses Require.js, browserify, grunt, SCSS, SVGs and jekyll to output modular elements and templates. I also enjoy including CSS animations in my projects and use have started experimenting with SVG animations. I ensure all code is fully accessible using BEM and latest web standards to create responsive multi device and browser compatible code. I use the command line daily and use git as version control. I use jquery and javascript but I would class this as my weakest area as I am working on improving this side of my skill set.</p>
