## To run locally to look over the working code follow these steps

1. You will need node on your machine visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and install.
2. `$ gem install jekyll` — If you don't already have jekyll on your machine.
3. `$ npm install` — To get all the dependencies for grunt.
